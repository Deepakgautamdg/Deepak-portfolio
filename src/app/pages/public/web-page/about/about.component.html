  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate and versatile Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. I graduated in 2024 from Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology and currently work as a Software Developer at Exsete Pvt. Ltd., where I built a custom monitoring tool from the ground up.

    My technical toolkit includes TypeScript, AngularJS, Java, Node.js, JavaScript, Docker, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, MongoDB, Puppeteer, Nmap, and C++. I’ve also worked with tools like SuiteCRM, gaining exposure to CRM integration and customization.

    Having worked in a startup environment, I’ve gained hands-on experience with system design and always strive to write clean, maintainable, and optimized code. I thrive on learning new technologies and solving real-world problems through efficient software solutions.
